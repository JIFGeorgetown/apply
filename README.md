# ðŸŽ‰ Meet the Judicial Innovation Fellowship ðŸŽ‰

Apply to be one of our inaugural fellows at the [Judicial Innovation Fellowship](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/tech-institute/programs/judicial-innovation/) (JIF)!

## What is JIF?

JIF is a brand new interdisciplinary program at Georgetown Law that places technologists and designers in state, local, tribal, and territorial courts to improve the public's access to justice. The goal is to develop open, replicable, and scalable solutions that make courts more transparent, equitable, and efficient. It is also an opportunity to seed culture change in courts by helping usher in the adoption of modern technology and user design practices.

## What will fellows do?

Our plan is to have our first cohort of fellows in courts around the US and tribal lands by September 2023.

Once placed, we anticipate our fellows will work on projects that improve data collection and interoperability, the usability of electronic filing, and incorporate user-design into public-facing court products. The injection of design and digital expertise across a range of carefully chosen court sites will prompt the emergence of replicable models and best practices, creating a multiplier effect that builds a 21st century justice system.
